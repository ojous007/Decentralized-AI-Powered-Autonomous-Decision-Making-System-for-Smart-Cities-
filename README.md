# 🌐 Multi-Language Translation System Using Big Data and Transformer Models

## 🎯 Objective
Build a real-time text translation web application using Transformer models trained on large multilingual datasets. The system allows seamless communication across different languages.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- 🤗 Transformers (Hugging Face)
- MarianMTModel & MarianTokenizer
- Gradio (for UI)
- PyTorch
- Google Colab (for development)
- Big Data (language corpora for training models)

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. User enters a sentence and selects source & target languages.
2. Model is loaded based on the language pair.
3. Text is tokenized and passed to the MarianMT model.
4. Model outputs translated tokens which are detokenized.
5. Translated result is displayed in the UI.

## 💼 Use Cases
- 🧳 Travel & Tourism: Real-time translation between visitors and locals.
- 🏥 Healthcare: Assisting multilingual interactions in clinics.
- 📚 Education: Helping students understand foreign-language content.
- 🛒 E-commerce: Translating product descriptions globally.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add voice translation (speech-to-text and text-to-speech).
- Translate entire documents (PDFs, TXT files).
- Deploy as a full-scale web or mobile app.

## 📌 How to Run (in Colab)
```python
!pip install transformers gradio
```

Then paste the code and run the app using Gradio inside Colab.
